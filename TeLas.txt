Try This 2-2 Display a Truth Table for the Logical Operators
In this project, you will create a program that displays the truth table for Java’s logical operators.
You must make the columns in the table line up. This project makes use of several features covered in
this chapter, including one of Java’s escape sequences and the logical operators. It also illustrates the
differences in the precedence between the arithmetic + operator and the logical operators.
1. Create a new file called LogicalOpTable.java.
2. To ensure that the columns line up, you will use the \t escape sequence to embed tabs into each
output string. For example, this println( ) statement displays the header for the table:
3. Each subsequent line in the table will use tabs to position the outcome of each operation under its
proper heading.
