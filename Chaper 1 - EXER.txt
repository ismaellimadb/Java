1. What is bytecode and why is it important to Java’s use for Internet programming?

Java Byte Code is the language to which Java source is compiled and the Java Virtual Machine understands. ... Bytecode is the compiled format for Java programs. Once a Java program has been converted to bytecode, it can be transferred across a network and executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java has had a profound effect on the Internet because it allows objects to move freely in Cyberspace. In a network there are two categories of objects that are transmitted between the Server and the Personal computer. The Dynamic Self-executing programs cause serious problems in the areas of Security and probability. Applet is an application designed to be transmitted over the Internet and executed by a Java-compatible Web browser. security: Prior to Java, most users did not download executable programs frequently, and those who did scanned them for viruses prior to execution.

2. What are the three main principles of object-oriented programming?
inheritance polymorphism encapsulation

3. Where do Java programs begin execution?
JVM

4. What is a variable?
A variable is like a some "box" of the user that he can store anything declared on to it and name it wherever he likes.

5. Which of the following variable names is invalid?
D. 67count

6. How do you create a single-line comment? How do you create a multiline comment?
//Single Comment

/*
Mult-line comment
*/

8. How do you create a block of code?
for(var = 1; var <=100; var ++)
{
	//block of code
}

9. The moon’s gravity is about 17 percent that of earth’s. Write a program that computes your
effective weight on the moon.
class MyWeight{
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		double grav = 17,wei = 75,gea = 9.807, mgr, myw;
		mgr = grav + gea / 100;
		myw = -mgr - -wei;
		System.out.println("In the moon my weight is " + myw);
		
	}

}

10. Adapt Try This 1-2 so that it prints a conversion table of inches to meters. Display 12 feet of
conversions, inch by inch. Output a blank line every 12 inches. (One meter equals approximately
39.37 inches.)
class InchesToMeters{
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		double meter, inche;
		int counter;
		
		counter = 0;
		for(meter = 1; meter <= 120; meter++)
		{
			inche = meter * 39.37;
			System.out.println(meter + " meter is " + inche + " inches. ");
			counter++;
			
		if (counter == 12){
			System.out.println();
			counter = 0;
		}
		}
	}

}

11. If you make a typing mistake when entering your program, what sort of error will result?
Syntax Error.

12. Does it matter where on a line you put a statement?
No.
